Do you like Javascript? Do you love Python?
Well, you'll most probably like Pyjammin, a way of writing Javscript code in a pythonic way.

Pyjammin implements a pythonic way of writing classes and built-in functions like iter, map, filter, range etc.
I think I'll rip-off some of the functions from MochiKit...

Work in progress.
